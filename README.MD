The memory game! A classic. Hard to imagine such a simple idea requiring three different code languages to reproduce!

Motivation

I am not a person who seamlessly picks up each language I've gained exposure to; I have to really work at it. For me javascript required
a particular effort and in recurring course assignments related to the memory game I had difficulty doing what I wanted to with js. This is my
stubborn as a mule attempt to once and for all conquer the memory game!
